# front-end-css

##Introduction 
This project started out as a takehome assignment for an interview, to create a website based on a mockup provided in Sketch. It has since been taken as a starting point for a project.  

##Deployment 
This is a simple web project, it can be deployed on any web server or local host. Please see the tool kit and known bugs for further details. 

##Tool Kit 
At this point, this page is a static html/css based website. I'd like to grow this site using a node.js and SQL database, or a rails and noSQL database. I'd like to build interactiveness using vanilla javascript (or jQuery), and a front end framework. 

##Upcoming Sprints  
* build interactiveness 
* add css animations 
* intergrate a backend 
* add a database
* add a front end framework and organize js 

##Known Bugs 

This appiclation is not 100% mobile responsive and needs some fixing. 
There is currently no back end to this page.
